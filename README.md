JavaScript Events

Interactive JavaScript Events This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript event handling to create interactive web elements. The webpage includes various sections showcasing different types of JavaScript events, such as mouse events, keyboard events, form events, focus/blur events, and event delegation.

Features

Mouse Events: Detects when a button is hovered over and when the hover ends, displaying a corresponding message. Keyboard Events: Captures the latest key pressed in a text input field. Form Events: Handles form submission without refreshing the page, displaying a submission message. Focus and Blur Events: Updates a message when an input field gains or loses focus.

Event Delegation: Uses a container with multiple buttons, allowing event delegation to handle clicks on any button and display a message with the button's label. How to Use

Hover over the button in the "Mouse Events" section to trigger mouse events. Type in the input field in the "Keyboard Events" section to see the latest key pressed. Submit the form in the "Form Events" section to see the submission message. Focus and blur the input field in the "Focus and Blur Events" section to see the focus change message. Click any button in the "Event Delegation" section to see which button was clicked.
